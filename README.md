# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors. It compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors models.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~XX%) and balanced performance across precision and recall.
